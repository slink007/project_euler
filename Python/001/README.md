## Project Euler Problem 1

### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.  The sum of these multiples is 23.  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Default Usage
```
$ python3 euler1.py

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.

```

### Alternate Usage
You may optionally pass in a different upper limit.
```
$ python3 ./euler1.py -l 10

The sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 10 is 23.


```
