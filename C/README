This folder will contain Project Euler solutions which are done in the C langauge.  Each challenge has its own folder.  Each solution will have the ability to pass in a "-h" flag to get the program to provide the user with more information about what it is doing.  Most (all?) programs will also have the ability to pass in options to expand the program's functionality beyond the stated Euler challenge.
