Project Euler Program 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  

You can run the program without arguments to solve this problem as stated.  You can optionally provide two other multiples, and 
a different limit, to work out variations of this same problem.
