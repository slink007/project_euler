/* Project Euler Program 22
 * Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
 * begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the 
 * alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical 
 * position in the list to obtain a name score.
 *
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which 
 * is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
 * would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 *
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
 *
 * Answer = 871198282
 */

/* An examination of the file shows that all letters in all names have the same
 * case (UPPER) and that the names are comma separated.  Also, there are no line
 * feeds or new lines until the end of the file so we can't read out a line at a
 * time with getline.
